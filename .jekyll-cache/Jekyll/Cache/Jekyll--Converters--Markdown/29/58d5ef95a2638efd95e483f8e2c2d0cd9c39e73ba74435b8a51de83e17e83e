I"É<p>I biked to the grocery store, bagel shop, and a couple of used bookstores on Tuesday. It was my first errand run on the bicycle since the Project started. Carried a backpack loaded with the following: toolkit (mini pump, tire levers, patch kit, multitool, 3-way metric wrench), a reading book, wallet, keys, phone, assorted pens and pads, gum. Sunglasses would have helped, I quickly discovered. The trip didnâ€™t take as long as I thought it would.</p>
