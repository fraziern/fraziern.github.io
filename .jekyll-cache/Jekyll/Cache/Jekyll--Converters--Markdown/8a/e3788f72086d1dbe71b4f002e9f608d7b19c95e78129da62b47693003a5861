<p>This is a tic tac toe game with a twist - there are 2 CPU characters. Your â€œopponentâ€ relies on a hybrid minimax AI to try to beat you, while your well-meaning but hapless AI assistant, â€œCrappy,â€ seems to always recommend the worst possible move. (Crappy uses a â€˜miniminâ€™ algorithm I created to always give the worst advice.)</p>
