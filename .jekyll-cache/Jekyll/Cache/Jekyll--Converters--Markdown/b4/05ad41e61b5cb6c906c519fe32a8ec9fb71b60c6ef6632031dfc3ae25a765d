I"¢<p>The civil judicial system in North Carolina has long featured a â€œMagistrateâ€™s Courtâ€ or Small Claims Court at its lowest rung. These courts were created to serve residents of the state who needed an avenue to inexpensively and quickly resolve disputes involving small sums of money. As Eric Steele observed in his 1981 paper â€œThe Historical Context of Small Claims Courts,â€ these courts focus on â€œthe ordinary day-to-day grievances and disputes involving the common man.â€ Without assuming that the disputes are simple just because they are â€œsmall,â€ the Small Claims Court has attempted to competently resolve the systemâ€™s largest docket of cases.</p>
