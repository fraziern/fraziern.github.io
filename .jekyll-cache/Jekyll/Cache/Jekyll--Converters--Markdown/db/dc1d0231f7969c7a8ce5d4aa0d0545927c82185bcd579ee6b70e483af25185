I"Q<p>I thought I’d take look, from a different angle, at how our State’s small claims filing fees have changed over the last quarter century. I wrote a recursive method (using Processing) that generated a line graph of percentage change from each of the 26 years prior to 2010. The blue line represents the first graph, 1984-2010.</p>
