I"Ð<p>In 2014 I took Joshua Davisâ€™s <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Programming-Graphics-I-Introduction-to-Generative-Art/782118657">online class on programming graphics and generative art</a>. Iâ€™ve long been a fan of Joshuaâ€™s work, and had played around with the Processing language enough to know how fun and powerful it is. So when I found out about the class I jumped at the chance to download a tiny bit of his genius into my brain.</p>
