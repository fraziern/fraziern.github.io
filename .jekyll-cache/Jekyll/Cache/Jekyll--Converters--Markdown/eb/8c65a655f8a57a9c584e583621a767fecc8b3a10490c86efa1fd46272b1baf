I"~<p>It’s been 2 weeks now since I started regular car-free life. Most days I bike to the “good” bus stop, two miles away, then take the bus to work, bike in tow. And last Sunday morning, I biked the entire 12 or so miles to the office. And if I need to run an errand near home, I walk or bike. It’s been mostly an easy transition, although there have been a few hiccups.</p>
