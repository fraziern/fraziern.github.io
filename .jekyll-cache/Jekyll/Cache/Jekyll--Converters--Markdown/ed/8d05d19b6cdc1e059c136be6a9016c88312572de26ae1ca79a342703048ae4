I"å<p>Iâ€™ve had ups and downs the last couple of days, with this project. On Thursday night, Stephanie found ourselves both needing the car. She had a church meeting to attend, and I had tickets to the Durham Bulls game for Miles and myself. I considered taking the bus to the game (Durhamâ€™s main bus terminal is literally right next to the Durham Bulls parking deck), but eventually we came up with a better plan. Iâ€™d take the car, weâ€™d drop her off at church, and sheâ€™d get a ride home. Everything went smoothly until I got a call a while later, while sitting at the game. â€œIâ€™m locked out of our house,â€ Stephanie coolly informed me. So todayâ€™s lesson is: make sure everyone has their keys, even if they are not driving!</p>
