This is a tic tac toe game with a twist - there are 2 CPU characters. Your "opponent" relies on a hybrid minimax AI to try to beat you, while your well-meaning but hapless AI assistant, "Crappy," seems to always recommend the worst possible move. (Crappy uses a 'minimin' algorithm I created to always give the worst advice.)
